After years of iterating on my portfolio, I decided to rebuild everything from scratch. This isn't just about a fresh coat of paint—it's about creating a foundation that can grow with me.

## The Problem with Iteration

When you iterate on an existing codebase for too long, you accumulate technical debt. Small compromises stack up. What started as a clean architecture becomes a patchwork of quick fixes and workarounds.

My previous portfolio was built with Vite and React. It worked fine, but:

- **No MDX support**: I couldn't write content-rich blog posts
- **No file-based routing**: Adding new pages required manual configuration  
- **Limited SEO**: Client-side rendering hurt discoverability

## The Solution: Start Fresh

I migrated to **Next.js 15** with the App Router. Here's what changed:

### Better Content System

With MDX support, I can now write posts like this one—mixing markdown with React components. Code blocks have syntax highlighting. I can embed interactive demos.

### Improved Performance

Server-side rendering means faster initial loads. Static generation for blog posts. Automatic code splitting. The lighthouse scores speak for themselves.

### Cleaner Architecture

The new codebase is organized around features:

```
src/
├── app/           # Routes
├── components/    # UI components
├── content/       # MDX blog posts
├── data/          # Static data
└── lib/           # Utilities
```

## What I Learned

Rebuilding taught me that **starting fresh isn't giving up**—it's leveling up. Sometimes the best refactor is a rewrite, especially when your requirements have fundamentally changed.

The key is knowing when to iterate and when to rebuild. If you're fighting your architecture more than building with it, it might be time for a fresh start.
