## Design Options

### 01 - Minimal + Bold Typography
**File:** `01-minimal-bold.png`
**Style:** Stripe, Linear inspired
**Prompt:**
```
A modern, clean portfolio website design mockup for a software engineer. Hero section with large bold typography showing "Kinshuk Goel" and subtitle "Building Intelligent Systems". Clean white background with subtle dotted pattern. Below the hero is a "Selected Work" section with a bento grid layout showing project cards - one large card spanning two columns showing "ZenTree Tabs" Chrome extension with a purple-blue gradient accent, smaller cards for other projects. Each card has a year badge, title, short description, and tech tags. Color scheme is minimal with white backgrounds, dark text, and soft blue accent color. Modern sans-serif typography (Inter font style). Professional and elegant like Anthropic or Stripe's website aesthetic. Desktop web view, no device frames.

### 02 - Bento Grid
**File:** `02-bento-grid.png`
**Style:** Apple, Raycast inspired
**Prompt:**
```
A modern bento grid portfolio website design for a software engineer named Kinshuk Goel. Apple/Raycast inspired layout. The page shows a playful grid of mixed-size cards: a large hero card with name and title, a medium card showing "ZenTree Tabs" project with a glassmorphic preview, a small card with GitHub stats, a card with tech stack icons (React, Python, TypeScript), a card with a mini about section and photo placeholder, a card showing "Resume Analyzer" AI project, contact card with email. Cards have rounded corners, subtle shadows, different pastel accent colors (soft blue, lavender, mint). Clean white background. Modern sans-serif typography. Whimsical but professional. Desktop web view, no device frames.

**Style:** Developer/Cyberpunk inspired
**Prompt:**
```
A dark terminal/hacker aesthetic portfolio website for software engineer Kinshuk Goel. Deep black background with green or cyan monospace text. ASCII art header showing the name. Terminal-like interface elements: a blinking cursor, command prompts showing "ls projects/", output showing project listings in tree structure. Matrix-style subtle falling characters in background. Code syntax highlighting for project descriptions. Retro CRT monitor glow effects on text. Projects shown as "files" in a terminal tree view. Tech stack displayed as package.json style dependencies. Contact shown as git remote URLs. Cyberpunk/developer aesthetic. Dramatic and unique. Desktop web view, no device frames.
